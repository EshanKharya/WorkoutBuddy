Instructions:
Fork the project and work on it locally. Do not create branches as I will not be checking any pull requests. This is simply a reference for you guys.
Before you run the server, ensure that you do the following:
1. run npm init -y in your working directory.
2. run "npm install" or "npm i" in the parent directory to install all the node packages
3. change the config file: change the PORT and dbURL variables to your local environment variables.
4. Run the server and populate the collections with some dummy data using Postman (this data can be produced using chatgpt)
5. Verify the data in your MongoDB Compass.
6. Add more data and check if all the routes are working properly.
